ENGR 1125 Matlab Library
=============
+ This Library of functions generates [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) plots useful in my Introduction to Sensors Instrumentation and Measurment Class, including
	+ bode plots 
	+ XY plots
	+ calibration plots
	+ reading csv files, without requirement that file is all numbers
+ I also included an Excel spreadsheet that is used to calculate the resistor and capacitor values in a band pass filter
+ The functions all read csv files from sesnsor data generates in the [waveforms](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/software/waveforms/waveforms-3/start) software
